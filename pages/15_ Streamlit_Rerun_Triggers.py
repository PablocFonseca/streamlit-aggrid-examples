AgGrid will trigger app refresh based on the event names supplied via `update_on` parameter.  
            
    update_on: list[string | tuple[sting, int]], optional
        Defines the events that will trigger a refresh and grid return on streamlit app.
        valid string named events are listed in https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/grid-events/.
        If a tuple[string, int] is present on the list, that event will be debounced by x milliseconds.
        for instance:
            if update_on = ['cellValueChanged', ("columnResized", 500)]
            Grid will return when cell values are changed AND when columns are resized, however the later will
            be debounced by 500 ms. More information about debounced functions 
            here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-debounce-example/
