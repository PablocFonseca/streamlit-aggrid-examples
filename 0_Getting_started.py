## Simple use
The simplest way to use the grid is to pass a pandas Dataframe to AgGrid call.   
Grid will infer column names and data types from the dataframe and render.  
The examplle below renders numbers right aligned and formats iso date columns.

from st_aggrid import AgGrid
import pandas as pd
  
df = pd.read_json("https://www.ag-grid.com/example-assets/olympic-winners.json")
grid_return = AgGrid(df)
```
